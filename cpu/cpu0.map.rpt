Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "dest_reg" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "dest_reg" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "sour_reg" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "sour_reg" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "offset" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "offset" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "sci" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "sci" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "sst" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "sst" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "alu_out_sel" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "alu_out_sel" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "alu_in_sel" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "alu_in_sel" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "alu_func" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "alu_func" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "wr" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "wr" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
Warning: VHDL Process Statement warning at controller.vhd(23): signal or variable "rec" may not be assigned a new value in every possible path through the Process Statement. Signal or variable "rec" holds its previous value in every path with no new value assignment, which may create a combinational loop in the current design.
